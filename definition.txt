üß† Project Goal
Build a browser-based interactive simulation platform where users can create, customize, and experiment with realistic 2D physical objects. Users can set physical properties such as mass, density, elasticity, friction, and observe how they behave under various conditions (gravity, collisions, etc.).

üéÆ User Controls (Editable for Each Object)
Shape: rectangle, circle, polygon

Dimensions: width, height, or radius

Mass: (kg)

Density: (kg/m¬≤)

Friction Coefficient: (0 - 1)

Elasticity (Restitution): (0 - 1)

Air Drag / Resistance (optional)

Is Static: true / false (for walls, floors)

Is Hollow: true / false (optional)

Initial Position: (x, y)

Initial Velocity: (vx, vy)

Rotation: (angle in degrees)

Angular Velocity (optional)

Custom Tags: e.g. wood, metal, rubber

‚öôÔ∏è Physics Concepts
Gravity

Mechanics of Collisions

Friction

Elasticity

Mass-Density-Area Relationship

Angular Momentum (optional)

External Forces (Wind, Buoyancy) (optional/advanced)

üî¨ Features to Simulate
Collision behavior (bounce, slide, stick)

Motion under gravity

Interaction between static and dynamic objects

Optional: Air resistance, wind, and buoyancy effects

Visualization of velocity and force vectors (optional)

üåà Visual/Meta Properties (for display only)
Color

Material texture

Label/Name

Show bounding box, velocity, or force vectors (toggle)

üîß Libraries and Tech Stack
Physics Engine: Matter.js

UI Framework: HTML/CSS + Vanilla JS or React

Canvas Renderer: Matter.js + custom canvas drawing or use matter-js-render

Optional Enhancements:

dat.GUI or a custom sidebar panel for real-time property editing

Chart.js or similar to visualize motion or forces over time
